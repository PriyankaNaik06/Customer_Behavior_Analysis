# Customer_Behavior_Analysis

Customer Behavior Data Analyst Portfolio Project
This project represents a complete, industry standard, end-to-end data analytics workflow, designed to mirror the real responsibilities of professional analysts in modern business environments. The project encompasses all critical stages of data analysis, from data preparation and modelling to insight generation, visualization, and reporting.


Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate a corporate-grade end-to-end data analytics workflow, demonstrating the ability to translate raw data into strategic business intelligence by:
1) Data Preparation, Modelling & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python): Clean and transform the raw dataset for analysis.
2) Data Analysis (SQL): Simulate business transactions, and run queries to extract insights on customer segments, loyalty, and purchase drivers.
3) Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Build an interactive dashboard that highlights key patterns and trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
